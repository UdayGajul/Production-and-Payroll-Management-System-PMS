# Production and Payroll Management System (PMS) by Uday Gajul

The project idea is to develop an application (PMS) for Gajul Fabrics through which they can manage their daily production and generate reports.
## Installation

To run the program, you need to install the following libraries/modules:

- *tkinter*: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit.
- *ttkbootstrap*: A library for creating themed widgets using Bootstrap CSS framework.
- *matplotlib*: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualization in Python.
- *pillow*: Python Imaging Library (PIL), used for working with images.
- *mysql-connector-python*: A module for connecting Python programs with MySQL databases.

You can install these libraries/modules using pip. Open your command-line interface and run the following commands:

```bash
  pip install tkinter

  pip install ttkbootstrap

  pip install matplotlib

  pip install pillow

  pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Make sure you have pip installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
## Project Background

This project was developed as part of my Master's first-year in Computer Science, second-semester field project. It serves as a culmination of academic learning and practical application in the field of computer science.

Note: This standalone application is specifically tailored for use by Gajul Fabrics. Its functionality and features are designed to meet the specific needs of this organization and may not be suitable for other purposes.

- The application facilitates production management and report generation for Gajul Fabrics.
- Developed using Python and various libraries such as tkinter, ttkbootstrap, matplotlib, and Pillow.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for efficient management of production processes.
- Generates detailed reports to aid in decision-making and analysis.
- Utilizes MySQL database for storing and retrieving production data.
- Designed to streamline workflow, reduce manual recording and analysis of production and salaries, and improve overall productivity within the organization.
- Additionally, it includes functionality to manage and save salary information for workers.
This comprehensive set of features is why it is named the Production and Payroll Management System
